# SNS Account Generator

### Description
This script generates accounts for SNS using the gmail number trick. It was originally used by myself on a catch-all email domain but has been adapted for gmail as requested. It generates a user specified number of accounts before saving them in accounts.txt which must be present for the script to work.

### Requirements
- requests `pip install requests`
- bs4 `pip install bs4`
- python3 (or the ability to perform small changes to make it python2 compatible)
- a gmail email address

### Instructions
- Download ZIP and extract all files or git clone into repo
- Check the code to make sure you are happy with the details being used in the account (name and country, address not needed to simply create an account)
- Run accountGenerator.py
- Fill in your gmail prefix **NOTE: THIS IS THE FIRST PART OF YOUR EMAIL ONLY, SO PREFIX OF RYAN78AG@GMAIL.COM IS RYAN78AG**
- Input the desired password for all the accounts
- Input the number of accounts you would like to create

### FAQ
Will you help me?
*No, this script is super simple to use and you should work it out on your own. Use google for support if needed.*
